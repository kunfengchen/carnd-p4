# Carnd-P4: Advanced Lane Finding
A software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in video from a front-facing camera on a car.
The camera calibration images, test road images, and videos are available in this [repository](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines).

### Camera Calibration
OpenCV functions or other methods are used to calculate the correct camera matrix and distortion coefficients using the calibration chessboard images provided in the repository.
